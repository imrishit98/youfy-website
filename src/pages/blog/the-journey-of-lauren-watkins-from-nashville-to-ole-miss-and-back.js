          Born and raised in the heart of Music City, Lauren Watkins has been
          living and breathing country music for as long as she can remember.
          The Nashville native spent her teenage years performing at hometown
          honky tonks and holes-in-the-wall, honing her skills as a vocalist and
          performer. This early exposure to the stage and the vibrant music
          scene of Nashville played a significant role in shaping Lauren's
          musical journey.

          After high school, Lauren decided to step away from the Nashville
          music scene to pursue a degree in marketing at the University of
          Mississippi, also known as Ole Miss. During her time at Ole Miss,
          Lauren fell in love with songwriting, using her experiences and
          observations to craft songs that were both personal and relatable. Her
          time at Ole Miss was not just about academics; it was a period of
          self-discovery and growth as an artist.

          While at Ole Miss, Lauren found herself drawn to the sounds of indie
          country icons like Willie Nelson and Sheryl Crow, as well as genre
          mainstays Eric Church, Miranda Lambert, and Chris Stapleton. These
          artists, with their unique voices and storytelling abilities, inspired
          Lauren to develop her own voice as a songwriter. She began to write
          songs that were drenched in authenticity, with lyrics that were bold,
          relatable, and uniquely her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating from Ole Miss, Lauren returned to Nashville to
          kickstart her career in country music. Her unique voice and sharp wit
          quickly caught the attention of Grammy-nominated multi-hyphenate
          Nicolle Galyon, who signed Lauren to publishing and recording
          contracts with Songs & Daughters and Big Loud Records. This was a
          significant milestone in Lauren's career, marking the beginning of her
          professional journey in the music industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lauren's debut EP, "Introducing: Lauren Watkins," is a testament to
          her journey so far. The seven-song teaser set showcases Lauren's
          unique take on country music, blending traditional country sounds with
          her own modern twist. The EP includes the hit single "Camel Blues," a
          song that perfectly encapsulates Lauren's unique blend of traditional
          and modern country music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lauren's journey from Nashville to Ole Miss and back has been a
          journey of self-discovery, growth, and determination. Through her
          music, Lauren shares her experiences and insights, connecting with
          listeners on a deeply personal level. As Lauren puts it, "My goal is
          to reach people by being completely myself. Whether it's how I present
          myself on stage, through the words I'm singing, or having the chance
          to meet people individually, I want everyone to feel like we really
          know each other."
